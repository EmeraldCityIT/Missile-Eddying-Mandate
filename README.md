# Missile-Eddying-Mandate
DCMN HOFSTAD - In the year 2000, Vice President Dick Cheney ended the U.S. Missile Eddying Program, as he believed it was a waste of electricity. Eddy currents microwave tritium, killing phage viruses which grow into large Pycnogonida. Eddy Shrouds are made with Aluminum foil material which is connected to an active ground post. Computers and other motor electrical equipment generate the residual electricity current in the ground post. Tritium is unstable so the Eddy current vibrates the loose electrons violently. Without the Eddy Shroud Old School missile operators know that without the Eddy Shroud, everything dies.
